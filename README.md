# SimpleCipherRC
A super-lean MVVM implementation in Swift and ReactiveCocoa4

The original SimpleCipher was a very simple example of MVVM architecture with no 3rd party dependencies [1]. Just Swift. To offer an alternative, this new example project uses ReactiveCocoa 4 to link the Model to ViewModel, and ViewModel to Model. A collection of utility methods from Colin Eberhardt was included, and can also be accessed in their original form at [2].
